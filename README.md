Home screen is the main log in page at the moment. I have firebase set up set up to hold users information(name, password, and birthday). Used Next.js and Tailwind.CSS to style components. This was my first time using Tailwind so it took me some time to learn it. The projexct is incompete, the furthest the user can go is to the birthday screen, however after clicking next the user's birthday is stored.
